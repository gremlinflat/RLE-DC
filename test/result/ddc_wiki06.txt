Both 0 LZ77 5 LZ78 algorithms work 21 35 principle. 78 LZ77, 3 circular buffer called 0 "sliding window" holds 0 last N 128 1 6 processed. 42 window serves 2 0 dictionary, effectively storing every substring 19 has appeared 4 0 past N 128 2 dictionary entries. Instead 1 3 single 195 identifying 3 dictionary entry, 50 values 33 needed: 0 length, indicating 0 length 1 0 matched text, 5 0 offset (also called 0 distance), indicating 19 0 match 9 found 4 0 sliding window starting offset 128 before 0 current text. LZ78 72 3 95 explicit dictionary structure; at 0 beginning 1 0 17 process, 0 dictionary 9 empty. An 195 57 1 zero 9 32 7 represent 0 end 1 3 string, 101 0 first 195 1 0 dictionary 9 one.
